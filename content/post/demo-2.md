When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!

If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.

A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.

Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.
